## Project Background
>You are the mayor of Simp City, and you want to build the happiest and most prosperous 
city possible, i.e., score the most points.
This city-building strategy game is played over 16 turns. In each turn, you will build one 
of two randomly-selected buildings in your 4x4 city. In the first turn, you can build 
anywhere in the city. In subsequent turns, you can only build on squares that are 
connected to existing buildings. The other building that you did not build is discarded.
Each building scores in a different way. The objective of the game is to build a city that 
scores as many points as possible

## Project Approach
